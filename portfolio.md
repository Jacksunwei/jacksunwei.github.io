----------------------------
*Nov. 2013*

As TopCoder and CloudSpokes integrate, the APIs are going to play a critical role. 
TopCoder has launched a series of competitions on its platform to develop some APIs
using a more cloud-friendly approach built on [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org/).
I took one competition to accomplish the LDAP & Email Tasks for registration api and got first place 
in the final review. 

The main techniques includes: 

* JavaScript
* NodeJS
* [LdapJS](http://ldapjs.org/)
* OpenLDAP

this project include:

Breakout Clone
--------------
*Dec. 2008*

The last project in my first CS class - *Introduction to Programming*. 
I got an **A+** in this class (12 A+ out of 150+ students). 
The lecturer of this class is Shensheng Zhang. 
I am very grateful to him for his wonderful lectures and well designed projects. 
It is of great importance to me because it helps me find strong interest on computer science.
