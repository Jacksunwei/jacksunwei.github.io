========

## Current ##

* *Improments on NLP Dependency Parser* 2012.09 - Now

## Past ##

* *Query Suggestion System based on Knowledgebase* 2011.09 – 2012.09

    The project used a knowledge base developed by *MSRA*.
    It analyzed the queries submitted by users through search engine web pages
    and gave back related queries with better searching experiences.
    I took it as my thesis project and got an **A** grade in the final thesis defense.

* *Development of Agent-based Modeling Tools & Simulation Platform* 2010.09 – 2010.12

    The project was an Agent-based simulation platform used to simulate real business scenarios.
    I was in charge of the design of statistical module,
    including Data-collection Strategy and Data Structure of Simulation Results, etc.

* *Research of Correlation among Randomness Tests* 2010.05 – 2010.09

    The project was a preliminary research on the correlation among various Randomness Tests.
    It was under Participation in Research Program (short for PRP) of SJTU.
    I was in charge of code reordering, coding new tests and some preliminary experiment.
    The result of this project was collected as a research paper of PRP.
